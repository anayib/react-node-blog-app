        I was born in Bogotá, Colombia. Colombia with “o" not “u". My grand
        father from my father’s family was Lebanese, that’s why I have this non
        Colombian name.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was a teenager I loved computers, video games, philosophy and
        playing instruments. I remember that I used to go to the Luis Angel
        Arango library in Bogotá to study HTML, CSS, and MySQL from books, yes,
        from books, I didn’t even had a computer back then (early 2000’s).
      </p>
      <p>
        I graduated in Colombia from a business School, but to be honest, I
        spent most of the time studying logic, philosophy, and anthropology,
        mainly from what is now days related to user research and how to apply
        it to create products and experiences.
      </p>
      <h2>Europe, data, machine learning, and my first IT business</h2>
      <p>
        In my early 20’s I moved to Europe and worked at Dell Computers. I also
        did an MBA. This experiences helped me realize that what I liked the
        most was technology and how it could serve people to improve their
        lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Paradoxically, the best teacher I have ever had in the business strategy
        field, had an undergraduate degree in philosophy, not business. At the
        time he was my teacher, he was also the main strategy adviser of an
        important retail firm in Europe. I will always thank him to introduce me
        in the world of conceptual thinking. Thanks Manuel!
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to strengthen my skills in the technology field, I moved to
        France, where I studied a Master in the field of Data Science and
        Machine Learning. At that time, around 2008, my work for the master was
        mainly focused on how to capture, classify, visualize and make decisions
        based on data.
      </p>
      <p>
        My studies in that field helped me create and sell my first product that
        turned into a business. A simple solution to capture and visualize data
        that served small businesses and universities to make decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        After selling my first business, and visiting different countries with
        the purpose of expanding my vision of the world while interacting with
        several cultures, I came back to Colombia with the willing of supporting
        the largest amount of people I could.
      </p>
      <h2>Helping people, my mantra for the following years</h2>
      <p>
        I wanted to help people the right way, so I decided to prepare my self
        on education. I enrolled in a short course from Harvard with professor
        David Perkins, which taught me the Teaching for Understanding education
        approach. From that moment on, I discovered I loved education, and how
        it is a great way to help others.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I wanted to help people in an efficient way, I decided to work close
        to the main universities in Colombia. After that, I decided to come back
        to Europe, but the Colombian Ministry of Information and Communication
        Technologies invited me to co-create with a great team what today is
        known as
        <a href="https://www.apps.co" target="_blank">
          {" "}
          Apps.co
        </a>
        , the largest IT entrepreneurship program in the region and the one that
        kicked off the entrepreneurship mindset of thousands of Colombian
        entrepreneurs - along with other initiatives executed by great people
        from other Colombian institutions like Innpulsa, SENA, and the MInistry
        of Commerce - .
      </p>
      <p>
        By this time, early 2012, I met Bob Dorf, Steve Blank and Alex
        Osterwalder, who helped us improve the Apps.co program. From this point
        until today, Bob became my mentor and friend. Thanks Bob!.
      </p>
      <p>
        I invested a year travelling around the country helping entrepreneurs
        and institutions to strengthen their entrepreneurship mindset and
        skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that fulfilling experience, I invested almost 2 years working in
        Colombia and other countries like Mexico and Brasil. I helped
        entrepreneurs from different accelerators and several corporations that
        started to implement innovation methodologies to launch new internet
        products to the market (

        , Telefónica among others).
      </p>
      <h2>My new adventure: EdTech and Software as a Service</h2>
      <p>
        After this amazing experience helping people getting their projects
        done, in 2014 I decided to create a platform to help all those who
        wanted to learn how to start something from nothing. I wanted to write
        the code and create the content myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        My coding skills by early 2014 were mainly related to what you need to
        work in high intensity data manipulation, but poorly related to web
        development. I started looking for the best place to learn web
        development in Colombia, based more in the experience of the mentors
        rather than the certifications or diplomas, and I am so grateful that I
        met German Escobar, the person who has became my friend and business
        partner for the last 6 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Germán Escobar started
        <a href="https://www.makeitreal.camp" target="_blank">
          {" "}
          Make It Real{" "}
        </a>
        in 2014, after creating and making grow the main SMS communications
        company in Colombia and Perú.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, he was the reliable person to learn from about web development.
        My thought at that time was : “He is not only a great programmer, but
        also an entrepreneur who knows by experience in the field how to deploy
        products to production that need to support millions of interactions in
        real time ". I decided to learn web development from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I became a business partner at Make It Real. After graduating from its
        first training batch, I created
        <a href="http://www.innovationlessons.com/" target="_blank">
          {" "}
          Innovation Lessons
        </a>
        , a platform used for thousands of early entrepreneurs in LATAM, and
        later with German we created
        <a href="http://www.convertloop.co/" target="_blank">
          {" "}
          ConvertLoop
        </a>
        , - at the beginning because we needed it for Make It Real - .(I will
        write an article sharing the ConvertLoop experience and how we tried to
        avoid a "market street fight").
      </p>
      <p>
        Being partners at ConvertLoop and Make it Real, we decided I will
        focused on ConvertLoop and he will keep his attention on Make It. Late
        2019, after 4 years of hard work, we sold to a corporation the advanced
        data analysis and smart segmentation algorithms we wrote for
        Convertloop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I dedicate my time to teach and create products and experiences
        for
        <a href="https://www.makeitreal.camp" target="_blank">
          {" "}
          EdTech
        </a>
        . I write code for personal projects at least 4 hours a day, and I will
        share my previous and upcoming experiences on this blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who has asked me, I will create another article about my
        experience at
        <a href="https://launchschool.com/" target="_blank">
          {" "}
          Launch School
        </a>
        , one about how the Jobs to Be Done changed the way I see the business
        world, what is the best way to work with a remote team, and other topics
        related to coding, education and startups. (I will link to them here
        when ready. Stay tuned)
